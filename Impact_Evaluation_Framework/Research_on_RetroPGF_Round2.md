               Nominees will create a self-reported impact evaluation based on the impact their projects have had on the Ethereum Ecosystem and their ripple or direct impact on the Optimism Ecosystem.

                Each project that has submitted a self-reported evaluation and has registered on the IEF platform will, at random, be assigned to evaluate 5 peer projects self-reported evaluations. Peer evaluations will be anonymous, meaning the evaluated projects will be unable to tell who evaluated them, which helps reduce collusion and retaliation. They will also be preserved as binary attestations within the UniRep protocol: meaning an evaluating project may only approve or dissaprove the self report issued by a peer.

              Optimism Badgeholders will receive a capped random set of projects to evaluate. By capping the number of projects to be evaluated, badgeholders do not need to spread themselves thin. Additionally, through the use of the Impact Evaluation Framework and the results of the peer evaluation, badgeholders will have an increased amount of information to base their decisions on.
