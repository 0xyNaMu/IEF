Currently, there is no framework to measure the impact projects working in the Public Goods space have generated. This is particularly difficult for Community and Education projects, who often do not have the knowdlege on how to create and measure KPI's that demonstrate the value they generate to the Ethereum Ecosystem. This represents a challenge in the allocation of Public Good funding as most recently seen in Optimisms RetroPGF Round 2. 

CryptoYollotl solves this challenge by enabling the:

1. **Improvement of the evaluation process**: Reduction of the time needs for badgeholders to evaluate the projects and generates a consensus around how to decide what is generating impact for the ecosystem. 

2. **Secure continued funding**: Impact = funding, if people are able to effectively communicate the impact they are having they will be able to secure funding from diverse sources. 

3. **Preservation of public goods**: Prevents financial difficulties and discontinuation of self-funded projects, maintaining valuable contributions to the ecosystem.

4. **Inclusive determination of valuable KPIs**: Incorporates perspectives of generators and funders for accurate assessment of a projects impact. As an opt-in framework, projects will be able to determine bottoms-up the KPI's that are valuable to their projects, and shine visibility in what matters which could be overseen by others. 

5. **Improvement of the RetroPGF evaluation mechanism**: By adding a layer in which projects, based on qualifying metrics, anonymously evaluate each other following this framework, RetroPGF can further develop the community of projects furthering the ecosystem and support their evolution. 

This framework facilitates evaluation, funding, preservation, and inclusive determination of valuable KPIs for public goods projects. It particularly is a tool that will solve the evaluation process seen in RetroPGF Round2.
